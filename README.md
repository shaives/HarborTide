# HarborTide

HarborTide is a project aimed at measuring tide data and analyzing its development over time, particularly its impact along coastal military installations. The project integrates data collection, analysis, and visualization to provide insights into the changing tide level patterns and their implications for coastal military infrastructure.

## Objective
The primary objective of HarborTide was to understand how tide data has evolved over time and its potential impacts on coastal military installations. By examining historical tide data and combining it with geographic information system (GIS) data of military installations, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and potential vulnerabilities associated with tidal fluctuations.

## Features
- Data Collection: HarborTide gathered tide data from various sources, including historical records, tide gauges, and satellite imagery.
- Analysis: The project employed statistical analysis techniques to analyze tide data and identify patterns.
- Visualization: HarborTide provides visualizations to depict tide trends, spatial distribution, and their impact on military installations.
- Reporting: The project generated reports highlighting key findings and recommendations based on the analysis of tide data.

## Technologies Used
- Python: for data collection and analysis.
- Pandas, NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: for data visualization.
- GIS tools: for spatial analysis and mapping.
- GitHub: for version control and collaboration.

## Usage
To use HarborTide:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/harbortide.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Review the functions_tide script to find tools to collect and analyze tide data.
4. Explore the visualizations and reports generated by the project.
