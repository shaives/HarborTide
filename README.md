# HarborTide

HarborTide is a project aimed at measuring tide data and analyzing its development over the years, particularly focusing on its impact on military installations along coastal lines. The project integrates data collection, analysis, and visualization to provide insights into the changing tide patterns and their implications for coastal military infrastructure.

## Objective
The primary objective of HarborTide is to understand how tide data has evolved over time and its correlation with changes in coastal military installations. By examining historical tide data and combining it with geographic information data of military installations, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and potential vulnerabilities associated with tidal fluctuations and increase.

## Features
- Data Collection: HarborTide gathers tide data from NOAA, including historical records, tide gauges
- Analysis: The project employs statistical analysis to analyze tide data and identify patterns.
- Visualization: HarborTide provides visualizations to depict tide trends

## Technologies Used
- Python: for data collection, analysis
- Pandas, NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: for data visualization
- GitHub: for version control and collaboration.

## Usage
To use HarborTide:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/harbortide.git`
2. Download data from NOAA - See README /data/tide_sensors
3. Run the main script to collect and analyze tide data
4. Explore the visualizations and reports generated by the project

## Files/Folders
- main.py
  Calls all the functions, would serve for working thruogh futre argutemnts
- functions_tide.py
  Has all the functions for collecting, organizing, plotting and map creating
- test.ipynb
  Same functions as in functions_tide.py - for easier development, so you dont have to read in all the data every time you run the main.
- harbouTide.html
  Interactive map with all bases in specified stats as well as tide sensors
- data/military-bases.csv
  datafile for all US military bases in the USA
