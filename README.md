# HarborTide

HarborTide is a project aimed at measuring tide data and analyzing its development over the years, particularly focusing on its impact on military installations along coastal lines. The project integrates data collection, analysis, and visualization to provide insights into the changing tide patterns and their implications for coastal military infrastructure.

## Objective
The primary objective of HarborTide is to understand how tide data has evolved over time and its correlation with changes in coastal military installations. By examining historical tide data and combining it with geographic information system (GIS) data of military installations, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and potential vulnerabilities associated with tidal fluctuations.

## Features
- Data Collection: HarborTide gathers tide data from various sources, including historical records, tide gauges, and satellite imagery.
- Analysis: The project employs statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze tide data and identify patterns.
- Visualization: HarborTide provides interactive visualizations to depict tide trends, spatial distribution, and their impact on military installations.
- Reporting: The project generates reports highlighting key findings and recommendations based on the analysis of tide data.

## Technologies Used
- Python: for data collection, analysis, and machine learning.
- Pandas, NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: for data visualization.
- GIS tools: for spatial analysis and mapping.
- GitHub: for version control and collaboration.

## Usage
To use HarborTide:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/harbortide.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to collect and analyze tide data.
